# **Quarterly production**

# This program runs all the needed programs for creating the index for a quarter. Most of the other programs are included and executed from here. The parameteres will change for each period

# ## Import the necessary Python packages
# If the packages are not installed, use `pip install` from a terminal window to install, for instance `pip install pyarrow` and `pip install jupytext --upgrade`

# #!pip install pyarrow itables

# **Standard deviations from the mean:**
#
# This method assesses how far each data point is from the mean (average) value of the dataset. It uses the concept of standard deviation, which measures the spread or variability of the data around the mean.
#
# **Absolute Deviation from Median (MAD):**
#
# The Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) measures the distance between each data point and the median of the dataset. It’s robust against outliers and skewed data because the median is less affected by extreme values than the mean.
#
# **Acceptable price change from base price**
#
# The limits are set at own discretion
#
# ## Choose which outliers to be removed. 
# #### outlier_sd = 1 iteration of standard deviation from mean, 
# #### outlier_sd2 = 2 iteration of standard deviation from mean,
